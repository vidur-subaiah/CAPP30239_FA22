# Netflix Originals Data Exploration & Visualization - Vidur Subaiah 

## About the Project
I am an avid Netflix user and have witnessed how Netflixâ€™s business strategy in recent years has shifted towards the production of its own original content versus merely hosting content from other studios. I was therefore curious to find out about how different Netflix Originals have performed based on IMDB ratings.

This repository contains a number of data visualizations that provide key insights on this topic and help unravel an interesting story. If you have any questions about the visualizations or any feedback on the work, feel free to contact me at the following address: vidursubaiah@uchicago.edu

## About the Dataset
The dataset used is titled 'Netflix Original Films & IMDB Scores' and was obtained from Kaggle.  The dataset was created by scraping data from the 'Netflix Originals' Wikipedia page which was then combined with a dataset of matching IMDB scores.

The dataset contains information on all Netflix original films, documentaries, and specials that have been released as of June 1st 2021. The dataset contains the following important information: film title, film genre, film premiere date, film runtime, IMDB score, and languages the film is available in.

## How to Navigate the Project (Directory Structure)
The repository consists of three main directories:

* charts - contains all the code for the respective charts used in the project (one chart per file)
* data - contains the csv data file that is used by each of the charts
* images - contains the image assets that are displayed on the page

In addition to this, we have two main code files that have been placed at the root level of the project:

* index.html - this file contains all the html elements, styling, and layout of the page
* script.js - this file contains the javascript code used to manipulate data and build the charts
