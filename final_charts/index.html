        Netflix Originals - room for improvement? Interpreting IMDB scores of Netflix 
        Original films released as of June 2021
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        I am an avid Netflix user and have witnessed how Netflixâ€™s business strategy in recent years has 
        shifted towards the production of its own original content versus merely hosting content from other 
        studios. I was therefore curious to find out about how different Netflix Originals have performed 
        based on IMDB ratings.

    <h2>
        The average Netflix Original rating of 6.3 falls below the IMDB 
        site-wide average of 6.8 
    </h2>
    <p>The data indicates that since Netflix began producing its own film content, they have underperformed the average film according to movie reviewers on the IMDB platform.</p>
    <p>The company has had mixed fortunes - producing noteworthy flops such as 'Enter the Anime' (2/10 IMDB Score) alongside record-breaking documentaries like filmmaker David Attenborough's 'A Life on Our Planet' (one of the highest rated titles of all time on the IMDB plaform with a score of 9/10) </p>

    <h2>
        Netflix has been improving the number of successful 
        films that they produce
    </h2>
    <p>Despite the overall lower than average rating, the number of Netflix Originals ranked higher than the IMDB average (6.8) has been steadily increasing over the past couple of years. (Hover over each bubble below to view the number of releases that received a higher than average rating in a given year)</p>
    <p>In the year 2020, Netflix produced 48 titles that were rated higher than the IMDB average. This could point to an ongoing improvement in Netflix's ability to produce certain types of films that are deemed higher quality.</p>

    <h2>
        Short form content produced by Netflix has 
        performed notably well 
    </h2>
    <p>The data shows that short form films (films that have a runtime of less than 60 minutes) have been received well by movie reviewers, with median ratings consistently above the IMDB average of 6.8.</p>
    <p>Long form content produced by Netflix does have several strong outperformers, however, there is a good deal of variation, with numerous films underperforming the IMDB average. Focusing on improving the consistency and audience engagement of these longer films would help Netflix address this weakness.</p>

    <h2>The Documentary genre has been one of Netflix's main strengths</h2>
    <p>Documentary films produced by Netflix have performed strongly on IMDB. The average IMDB rating for Netflix documentaries stands at 6.9, which is above the IMDB sitewide 6.8 average.</p>
    <p>This trend is especially true for longer documentaries (80+ minutes). Additionally, Netflix's top 5 highest rated films of all time have all come from the documentary genre - 'A Life on Our Planet', 'Emicida: AmarElo - It's All for Yesterday', 'Springsteen on Broadway', 'Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom', and 'Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour'. This is clearly a successful niche that Netflix should look to maintain as well as further strengthen in the future.  </p>

    <h2>
        Most Foreign releases have underperformed according to critics
    </h2>
    <p>Foreign films that have been produced by Netflix (films produced primarily in a language other than English) have mostly received lukewarm reactions on IMDB. </p>
    <p>The average rating of these foreign films on the IMDB platform is equal to 6.0, which is well below the 6.8 sitewide average. This could indicate that Netflix needs to improve its ability to create films that take into account cultural contexts and the interests of foreign audiences.</p>
