# Netflix Originals Data

## Data Source
This dataset titled 'Netflix Original Films & IMDB Scores' was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores?resource=download). The dataset was created by scraping data from the 'Netflix Originals' Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_Netflix_original_films) which was then combined with a dataset of matching IMDB scores. 

## Data Description
The dataset contains information on all Netflix original films, documentaries, and specials that have been released as of June 1st 2021. The dataset contains the following important information: film title, film genre, film premiere date, film runtime, IMDB score, and languages the film is available in. 

## Why am I interested in this topic?
I am an avid Netflix user and I am interested in learning more about how different Netflix Original titles have been received by audiences. I am curious to know if there are any interesting trends or insights that I can find. Secondly, I know that Netflix's business strategy in recent years has revolved around producing its own titles. I would like to know how effective this strategy has been by comparing the ratings of Netflix original productions versus their rival studio counterparts. 

## How do I hope to use this data?
I hope to use this data to find interesting insights such as the following:
* How different Netflix Original genres have performed.
* Which were the best years for Netflix Original releases?
* Is there a relationship between runtime and ratings?
* Are Originals with higher ratings offered in more languages?

## Potential Data Points
Most of the data points within the file would be utilized, which include the following:
* Film genre
* Premiere date
* Film runtime
* IMDB score 
* Film languages

## Any concerns about the data?
One of the concerns about the data would be the data collection method. The csv file was created by an individual who scraped data from Wikipedia and then combined it with IMDB data. While these two sources of data are mostly reliable, there could potentially have been errors or omissions during the data scraping process. Another concern about the data would be the possibility that there are no real trends or relationships between the categorical variables, which would limit the number of insights that can be drawn from the data. 

## Primary or Secondary Source?
The data is partly secondary in nature since the data about the Netflix Originals was obtained from Wikipedia instead of Netflix itself. However, the IMDB ratings have been obtained directly from the IMDB pages for the respective titles. 

## How do you envision this data working with the primary source?
This data would work well with the primary source since we would be able to add additonal context and details to each of the titles by looking them up directly through Netflix. We could also address any potential errors by cross-referencing this primary source.
