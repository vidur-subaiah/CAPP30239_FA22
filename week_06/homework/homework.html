    <h1>Police Shootings Data Exploration</h1>
    <h3>Number of Police Shootings by Age Group</h3>
    <p>I chose this histogram to represent the age groups involved in police shootings. The histogram
        allows us to clearly see that individuals between the ages of 20-30 were the most 
        involved in shootings. Further information that breaks down this age group by gender or race would
        be helpful in this visualization.
    </p>

    <h3>Number of Police Shootings by Race</h3>
    <p>
        I chose this bar chart to represent the races involved in police shootings. The bar chart allows us to 
        clearly see which races were the most involved in shooting incidents (white and black in this data). Further demographic 
        information that highlights more about the people within the respective races could be useful. 
    </p>
    <div id="chart2"></div>
    <h3>Number of Police Shootings by Gender</h3>
    <p>
        I chose this pie chart to break down the police shootings by gender. The pie chart allows us to clearly see
        which gender is the most involved in shootings (male in this data) (the chart was also strengthened by only having three categories
        which helped make the point even clearer). Again, having additional demographic information and specific differences between the genders
        could be useuful supplementary information.
